For the past thirteen years, I've been either consuming [Zend Framework](https://framework.zend.com)
or directly contributing to it. Since 2009, I've operated as project lead, and,
since then, shepherded the version 2 and 3 releases, added
[Apigility](https://apigility.org) to the ZF ecosystem, and helped bring
middleware paradigms to the mainstream by assisting with the creation of
Stratigility and coordination of the [Expressive](https://getexpressive.org)
project. As I write this, the various ZF packages have been downloaded over 300
MILLION times, with 200 million of those being in the past 18 months!

<!--- EXTENDED -->

In the last three years, I have performed this work under the umbrella of
[Rogue Wave Software](https://www.roguewave.com), who acquired Zend in 2015.
However, Rogue Wave has recently made a strategic decision to focus its efforts
solely on the Zend Server product of the Zend portfolio. While Rogue Wave will
continue to support Zend Framework via the Zend Server service license
agreements, _*it will no longer continue to actively develop it*_ &mdash; and this
means both myself and [Enrico Zimuel](https://www.zimuel.it) will be leaving
the company and looking for new opportunities in the not-too-distant future,
along with [Zeev Suraski](https://zsuraski.blogspot.com) and Dmitry Stogov.

We all care deeply about the Zend Framework ecosystem, and we are evaluating
options to ensure its continuation and longevity. These include either finding a
new corporate sponsor for the project, or forming a foundation. This is where
YOU come in: if you work for a company that would be interested in supporting
such efforts, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out to me at
[matthew@weierophinney.net](mailto:matthew@weierophinney.net) with questions or
queries.
