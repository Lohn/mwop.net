Due to disorganization on my part, I accidentally booked [php[world] 2019](https://world.phparch.com)
to coincide with a family commitment.

<!--- EXTENDED -->

After reviewing a variety of options, I let the organizers know last week that I
could no longer attend. It's a situation I hate, because there's nobody to blame
but me, and no matter what option I could come up with, somebody would end up
disappointed or inconvenienced. For my part, my family had to come first.

Fortunately, the organizers at php[world] were able to convince [Ryan Weaver](https://twitter.com/weaverryan)
to fill in for me on the PHP and Frameworks panel, and to deliver a talk to
replace my slot in the program. I'm happy that he was able to step in!

I hope everyone attending the conference has a great experience! Next time, I'll
plan better!
