    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Full disclosure: I am employed by <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a> to
    program <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>. That said,
    the following is all my opinion, and is based on my experiences with Zend
    Framework, as well as answering questions on a variety of mailing lists and
    with other OSS projects (PEAR, Solar, and Cgiapp in particular).
</p>

<p>
    One of my biggest pet peeves in the OSS world is vague bug/issue reports and feature requests. I
    cannot count the number of times I've seen a report similar to the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
    &lt;Feature X&gt; doesn't work; you need to fix it <b>now!</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
    If such a report comes in on an issue tracker, it's invariably marked
    critical and high priority.
</p>

<p>
    What bothers me about it? Simply this: it gives those responsible for
    maintaining Feature X absolutely no information to work on: what result they
    received, what was expected, or how exactly they were using the feature. The
    reviewer now has to go into one or more cycles with the reporter fishing for
    that information -- wasting everyone's time and energy.
</p>

<p>
    Only slightly better are these reports:
</p>

<blockquote>
    &lt;Feature X&gt; doesn't work -- I keep getting &lt;Result X&gt; from it,
    which is incorrect.
</blockquote>

<p>
    At least this tells the reviewers what they reporter is receiving... but it
    doesn't tell them how they got there, or what they're expecting.
</p>

<p>
    So, the following should be your mantra when reporting issues or making feature requests:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>What is the minimum code necessary to reproduce the issue or show the desired API?</li>
    <li>What is the expected result?</li>
    <li>What is the actual result?</li>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    <a href="http://jansch.nl/">Ivo</a> already pointed this out, but I want to
    point it out again: Boy Baukema writes 
    <a href="http://www.ibuildings.nl/blog/archives/541-Backward-compatibility,-bane-of-the-developer.html">a very nice entry regarding backwards compatibility</a>
    on the ibuildings.nl corporate blog.
</p>

<p>
    Backwards compatibility (BC) is a tricky thing to support, even when you
    strive hard to, as Boy puts it, "think hard about your API" prior to
    release. Somebody will always come along and point out ways it could have
    been done better or ways it could be improved. I've had to wrestle with
    these issues a ton since joining the Zend Framework team, and while it often
    feels like the wrong thing to do to tell somebody, "too little, too late"
    when they have genuinely good feedback for you, its often in the best
    interest of the many users already using a component.
</p>

<p>
    I had the pleasure of meeting Boy last year when visiting the ibuildings.nl
    offices, and he's got a good head on his shoulders. He does a nice job
    outlining the issues and a number of approaches to BC; if you develop a
    project for public consumption, you should definitely head over and read
    what he has to say.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    In an effort to debug issues on a cluster, I was trying to determine which
    machine on the cluster was causing the issue. My idea was that I could
    insert a header token identifying the server.
</p>

<p>
    My first idea was to add the directive 'Header add X-Server-Ip
    "%{SERVER_ADDR}e" in my httpd.conf. However, due to the nature of our load
    balancer, Apache was somehow resolving this to the load balancer IP address
    on all machines of the cluster -- which was really, really not useful.
</p>

<p>
    I finally stumbled on a good solution, however: you can set environment
    variables in apachectl, and then pass them into the Apache environment using
    the PassEnv directive from mod_env; once that's done, you can use the
    environment variable anywhere.
</p>

<p>
    In my apachectl, I added the line "export HOSTNAME=`hostname`". Then, in my
    httpd.conf, I added first the line "PassEnv HOSTNAME", followed by the
    directive 'Header add X-Server-Name "%{HOSTNAME}e"'. Voila! I now had the
    hostname in the header, which gave me the information I needed for
    debugging.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/132-svnexternals.html">svn:externals</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I was recently working with someone who was using Zend Framework in their
    project. To keep things stable and releasable, he was doing an export of
    framework into his repository and checking it in. Since files change so much
    in the ZF project currently, instead of doing an rsync from a checkout into
    his own repository, he decided instead to delete the directory from the
    repository and re-add it everytime he was updating framework.
</p>
<p>
    This seemed really inefficient to me, especially considering that it made it
    incredibly difficult to merge changes from his development branch into his
    production branch (deleting and re-adding directories breaks the merge
    process considerably). I knew there had to be a better way.
</p>
<p>
    I'd heard of the svn:externals property before, but never really played with
    it. As it turns out, it exists for just this very type of situation. The
    problem is that the 
    <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.advanced.externals">documentation of svn:externals</a> 
    in the SVN book doesn't indicate at all how the property should be set, and
    most howto's I've read omit one or more very important details. I finally
    figured things out through some trial and error of my own, so I'm going to
    share the process so others hopefully can learn from the experience as well.
</p>
<p>
    It's actually pretty easy. This assumes that your project layout looks
    something like this:
</p>
<pre>
project/
    branch/
        production/
    tag/
    trunk/
</pre>
<ul>
    <li>In the top of your project trunk, execute the following:
<pre>
svn propedit svn:externals .
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>This will open an editor session. In the file opened by your editor,
    each line indicates a different external svn repo to pull. The first segment
    of the line is the directory where you want the pull to exist. The last
    segment is the svn repo URL to pull. You can have an optional middle
    argument indicating the revision to use. Some examples:
    <ul>
        <li>Pull framework repo from head:
<pre>
framework http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Pull framework repo from revision 2616:
<pre>
framework -r2616 http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk
</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>After saving and exiting, update the repo:
<pre>
svn up
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Commit changes:
<pre>
svn commit
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    One thing to note: any directory you specify for an svn:externals checkout
    should <b>not</b> already exist in your repository. If it does, you will get
    an error like the following:
</p>
<pre>
svn: Working copy 'sharedproject' locked
svn: run 'svn cleanup' to remove locks
</pre>
<p>
    I show using revisions above; you could also pin to tags by simply checkout
    the external repository from a given tag. Either way works well.
</p>
<p>
    Then, when moving from one branch to another, or from the trunk to a branch,
    you simply set a different svn:externals for each branch. For instance, your
    current production might check from one particular revision, but your trunk
    might simply track head; you then simply determine what the current revision
    being used is on your trunk, and update svn:externals in your production
    branch when you're ready to push changes in.
</p>
<p>
    Hope this helps some of you out there!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I may work at <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend</a>, but I've never been a
    fan of IDEs. They simply don't suit my programming style. I can usually keep
    track of file locations in my head pretty easily, and what I really need is
    a blank slate on which I can write, and one that doesn't consume resource
    that can better be used running web servers and other programs. Syntax
    highlighting, good indentation -- these are important, but you can get these
    from good, minimal text editors very easily. 
    <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim is my editor of choice</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I will admit, though, that one area where I have had IDE-envy is the area of
    code completion. I often find myself doing quick lookups to php.net or
    perldoc to determine the order of arguments to a function or method call,
    or checking for the expected return value. Most of the time, this doesn't
    take much time, however, so I just live with it.
</p>
<p>
    Today, however, cruising through the blogosphere, I came across 
    <a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/09/visual-walk-through-of-couple-of-new.html">an article showcasing some new features of Vim 7.0</a>, 
    and discovered Vim 7's code completion.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, while in insert mode, you can type &lt;C-x&gt; &lt;C-o&gt; to
    have vim attempt to autocomplete the current keyword. If more than one
    possibility exists, it shows a dropdown, and you can use your arrow keys to
    highlight the keyword that you wish to use.
</p>
<p>
    But it gets better! Not only does it do this kind of autocompletion, but it
    also opens a small 'scratch preview' pane showing the function/method
    signature -- i.e., the expected arguments and return value!
</p>
<p>
    I thought I had little need for IDEs before... now I have even less! Bram
    and the rest of the Vim team, my hat's off to you for more fine work!

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I upgraded <a href="http://www.s9y.org/">Serendipity</a> today, due to the
    recent announcement of the 1.0 release, as well as to combat some rampant
    issues with trackback spam.
</p>
<p>
    I've been very happy with Serendipity so far; it just runs, and the default
    install gives just what you need to get a blog up and running, and nothing
    more; any extra functionality comes via plugins which you, the blogger, get
    to decide upon.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, it's incredibly easy to upgrade. Unpack the tarball, rsync
    it over your existing install (I rsync it, because I don't use 'serendipity'
    as my directory name), visit the admin, boom, you're done. I've upgraded
    several times, and never lost data, nor configuration settings. 
</p>
<p>
    My primary reason for the upgrade was, as noted earlier, to combat trackback
    spam. As of this morning, I had 15,000 pending trackbacks, none of which
    appeared to be valid (if any of them were, and you're not seeing yours, I'm
    very sorry; I deleted them <em>en masse</em>). These had accumulated in <em>less than
    a month</em> -- that's an average of about one every 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
    Since upgrading, and using the <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>
    service, I've received not a single spam trackback. Needless to say, I'm
    happy I performed the upgrade!
</p>
<p>
    If you're a Serendipity user, and haven't upgraded to 1.0.0 yet (or one of
    it's reportedly very stable release candidates), do it today -- you have
    nothing to lose, and a lot of lost time to gain!

    earlier today, and felt compelled to respond.
</p>
<p>
    First, a rant: somehow, this article got posted on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>. 
    I've never heard of the guy who posted it, and some quick googling shows
    that he's a pythoner. He's simply fueling the language wars, and the

    In the post, the author makes an analogy of using PHP + MySQL as the
    equivalent of using BASIC, and then uses a quote that claims BASIC "has
    become the leading cause of brain-damage in proto-hackers." 
</p>
<p>
    I'm sorry, but using a language doesn't cause brain damage. And there are
    many levels to programming. And using Python, Ruby, C, C++, Java, etc., does
    not automatically make you a better programmer than those using one of
    "those other languages". You can write crap code in any language. You can
    also write great code in just about any language.
</p>
<p>
    Programming takes practice; programming well takes a lot of practice. You
    get better at it by learning more about programming practices, and applying
    them to your language. Part of programming is also learning when a
    particular language is suited to a task, and when it isn't. Python works for
    the web, but it's not particularly suited to it; similarly, you can write
    web servers in PHP, but that doesn't mean you should.
</p>
<p>
    Stop the language wars already! Stop writing incendiary pieces about a
    language you don't use regularly or never gained particular proficiency in,
    and code already!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/107-Telcos-are-Attacking-the-Internet.html">Telcos are Attacking the Internet</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I generally try to stay out of politics on this blog, but this time
    something has to be said, as it affects anyone who uses the internet, at
    least in the US.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, a number of telcos and cable providers are talking about charging
    internet content providers -- the places you browse to on the internet,
    places like Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, etc. -- fees to ensure bandwidth to
    their sites. Their argument is that these content providers are getting a
    'free ride' on their lines, and generating a lot of traffic themselves, and
    should thus be paying for the cost of bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
    This is patently ridiculous. Content providers already have to pay for their
    bandwidth -- they, too, have ISPs or agreements with telcos in place, either
    explicitly or via their hosting providers. Sure, some of them, particularly
    search engines, send out robots in order to index or find content, but,
    again, they're paying for the bandwidth those robots generate.
    Additionally, people using the internet are typically paying for bandwidth
    as well, through their relationship with their ISP. What this amounts to is
    the telcos getting paid not just by each person to whom they provide
    internet access, but every end point on the internet, at least those within
    the US.
</p>
<p>
    What this is really about is telcos wanting more money, and wanting to push
    their own content. As an example, let's say your ISP is AOL. AOL is part of
    Time Warner, and thus has ties to those media sources. Now, those media
    sources may put pressure on AOL to reduce bandwidth to sites operated by
    ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, Disney, PBS, etc. This might mean that your kid can no
    longer visit the Sesame Street website reliably, because AOL has reduced the
    amount of bandwidth allowed to that service -- but any media site in the TWC
    would get optimal access, so they could get to Cartoon Network. Not to slam
    Cartoon Network (I love it), but would you rather have your kid visiting
    cartoonnetwork.com or pbskids.org?  Basically, content providers would not
    need to compete based on the value of their content, but on who they can get
    to subscribe to their service.
</p>
<p>
    Here's another idea: your ISP is MSN. You want to use Google... but MSN has
    limited the bandwidth to Google because it's a competitor, and won't accept
    any amount of money to increase that bandwidth. They do the same with Yahoo!
    So, now you're limited to MSN search, because that's the only one that
    responds reliably -- regardless of whether or not you like their search
    results. By doing so, they've just artificially inflated the value of their
    search engine -- without needing to compete based on merit. 
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, let's say Barnes and Noble has paid MSN to ensure good
    bandwidth, but part of that agreement is a non-compete clause.  Now you find
    your connections to Amazon timing out, meaning that you can't even see which
    book provider has the better price on the book you want; you're stuck
    looking and buying from B&amp;N.
</p>
<p>
    Now, let's look at something a little more close to home for those of us
    developing web applications. There have been a number of success stories the
    last few years: MySpace, Digg, and Flickr all come to mind. Would these
    endeavors have been as successful had they needed to pay multiple times for
    bandwidth, once to their ISP and once each to each telco charging for
    content providers? Indeed, some of these are still free services -- how
    would they ever have been able to pay the extra amounts to the telcos in the
    first place?
</p>
<p>
    So, basically, the only winners here are the telcos.
</p>
<p>
    Considering how ludicrous this scheme is, one must be thinking, isn't the US
    Government going to step in and regulate against such behaviour? <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2006/tc20060426_553893.htm?chan=technology_technology+index+page_more+of+today">The answer, sadly, is no.</a>
    The GOP doesn't like regulation, and so they want market forces to decide.
    Sadly, what this will likely do is force a number of content providers to
    offshore their internet operations -- which is likely to have some pretty
    negative effects on the economy.
</p>
<p>
    The decision isn't final -- efforts can still be made to prevent it (the
    above link references a Senate committee meeting; there's been no vote on
    it). Call your representatives today and give them an earful. Tell them it's
    not just about regulation of the industry, but about fair competition in the
    market. Allowing the telcos to extort money from content providers will only
    reduce the US' economic chances in the world, and stifle innovation and
    choice.
