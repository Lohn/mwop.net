    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Those of you who know me well know that I've been using Linux as my primary
    OS for many years now. At this point, for me, using Windows is like deciding
    I'm going to use a limited vocabulary; I can get the idea across, but not
    quite as well.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the nature of where I work and the fact that I'm telecommuting, I've
    been having to maintain a dual-boot system. I use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> for my daily OS, and boot into
    Windows when I need to interact with people at work via <a href="http://www.webex.com/">Webex</a> or 
    <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> (we're using the new Skype beta
    with video, and it only works on Windows XP at this time).
</p>
<p>
    This week, however, I've had to stay on Windows quite a bit -- lots of
    impromptu conference calls and such. So, I've been customizing my
    environment, and been pretty pleased with the results.
</p>
<p>
    Continue reading for some tips on customizing your Windows XP environment to
    work and feel a little more like... linux.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Life is in transition for me now. Two weeks ago, we got to bring our
    handsome baby boy home, and I haven't been sleeping much since (though more
    than Jen). On top of the sleep deprivation, however, comes more exciting
    news: I've been hired as a PHP Developer by <a
        href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend Technologies</a>!
</p>
<p>
    I was approached by Daniel Kushner in late July regarding another position
    at Zend, and was flown out at the beginning of August. While I felt the
    interview went well, I harbored some doubts; work got fairly busy shortly
    thereafter, and then, of course, Liam was born, and the interview went
    completely out of my head. Until about three days after Liam's birthday,
    when Daniel contacted me again about the PHP Developer position.
</p>
<p>
    Work started yesterday, and I was flown to Zend's offices in Cupertino, CA,
    for orientation and to sit down with both Daniel and others to prepare for
    the projects on which I will be working. Thankfully, the job will not
    require that I move, and I will be working out of the 'home office' in
    Vermont when I return later this week.
</p>
<p>
    The decision to leave <a href="http://assoc.garden.org/about">NGA</a> was
    difficult, but the opportunity to work with Zend is just too good to miss. I
    am honored to be selected by them, and hope this is the beginning of many
    good things to come.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've been extremely busy at work, and will continue to be through the end of
    March. I realized this past week that I'd set a goal of having a <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_blank">SourceForge</a> website up
    and running for Cgiapp by the end of January -- and it's now mid-February.
    Originally, I was going to backport some of my libraries from PHP5 to PHP4
    so I could do so... and I think that was beginning to daunt me a little. 
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, I ran across a quick-and-dirty content management solution
    yesterday called <a href="http://gunther.sourceforge.net/"
        target="_blank">Gunther</a>. It does templating in Smarty, and uses a
    wiki-esque syntax for markup -- though page editing is limited to admin
    users only (something I was looking for). I decided to try it out, and
    within an hour or so had a working site ready to upload.
</p>
<p>
    Cgiapp's new site can be found at <a
        href="http://cgiapp.sourceforge.net/">cgiapp.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p>

<h4>UPDATE</h4>
<p>
    Shortly after I wrote this original post, I figured out what the strength of
    Gunther was -- and why I no longer needed it. Gunther was basically taking
    content entered from a form and then inserting that content (after some
    processing for wiki-like syntax) into a Smarty template. Which meant that I
    could do the same thing with Cgiapp and <a
        href="http://pear.php.net/text_wiki">Text_Wiki</a>. Within an hour, I
    wrote an application module in Cgiapp that did just that, and am proud to
    say that the Cgiapp website is 100% Cgiapp.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/54-Dreamweaver%2C-Text-Editors%2C-and-Webmasters.html">Dreamweaver, Text Editors, and Webmasters</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I picked up on <a href="http://osdir.com/slash3344.html">this article</a> on
    Friday, glanced through it and moved on, but noticed this evening it had
    been <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/08/2129250&tid=185">slashdotted</a>
    -- at which point I realized the author is the current <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/06/05/cgi.html">CGI::Application</a>
    maintainer, so I looked again.  </p> <p> At my first glance through it, it
    appeared the author was looking for a nice, easy-to-use pre-processor script
    for generating a site out of templates and content files. To that end, he,
    in the end, recommended <em>ttree</em>, part of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~abw/Template-Toolkit-2.14/">Template
        Toolkit</a> distribution.
</p>
<p>
    However, the real gist of the article -- something that should probably have
    been summarized at the end -- is that the author was looking for an free and
    OSS replacement for DreamWeaver's Templates functionality. This
    functionality allows a developer to create a template with placeholders for
    content, lock it, and then create pages that have the bits and pieces of
    content. Finally, the developer compiles the site -- creating final HTML
    pages out of the content merged with the templates.
</p>
<p>
    Now, I can see something like this being useful. I've used <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/JMASON/HTML-WebMake-2.2/webmake.raw">webmake</a>
    for a couple of projects, and, obviously, utilize PHP in many places as a
    templating language. However, several comments on Slashdot also gave some
    pause. The tone of these comments was to the effect of, "real developers
    shouldn't use DW; they should understand HTML and code it directly." Part of
    me felt this was elitist -- the web is such an egalitarian medium that there
    should be few barriers to entry. However, the <em>webmaster</em> in me --
    the professional who gets paid each pay period and makes a living off the
    web -- also agreed with this substantially.
</p>
<p>
    I've worked -- both professionally and as a freelancer -- with individuals
    who use and rely on DW. The problem I see with the tool and others of its
    breed is precisely their empowerment of people. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>
    I really do feel anybody should be able to have a presence on the 'net.
    However, HTML is a fragile language: trivial errors can cause tremendous
    changes in how a page is rendered -- and even crash browsers on occasion.
    The problem I see is that DW and other GUI webpage applications create, from
    my viewpoint, garbage HTML. I cannot tell you how many pages generated by
    these applications that I've had to clean up and reformat. They spuriously
    add tags, often around empty content, that are simply unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is compounded when individuals have neither time nor inclination
    to learn HTML, but continue using the tool to create pages. They get a false
    sense of accomplishment -- that can be quickly followed by a very real sense
    of incompetence when the page inexplicably breaks due to an edit they've
    made -- especially when the content is part of a larger framework that
    includes other files. Of course, as a web professional, I get paid to fix
    such mistakes. But I feel that this does everybody a disservice -- the
    individual/company has basically paid twice for the presentation of content
    -- once to the person generating it, a second time to me to fix the errors.
</p>
<p>
    This is a big part of the reason why I've been leaning more and more heavily
    on database-driven web applications. Content then goes into the database,
    and contains minimal -- if any -- markup. It is then injected into
    templates, which go through a formal review process, as well as through the
    <a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a> validators, to prevent display
    problems. This puts everybody in a position of strength: the editor
    generating content, the designer creating the look-and-feel, and the
    programmer developing the methods for mapping content with the templates.
</p>
<p>
    There's still a part of me that struggles with what I perceive as an elitist
    position. However, there's another part of me that has struggled heavily
    with the multitasking demands made on all web professionals -- we're
    expected to be editors, graphic designers, programmers, and more. In most
    cases, we're lucky if we're strong in one or two such areas, much less
    passionate about staying abreast of the changing face of our medium.

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    It's now been confirmed: I'm a geek. 
</p>
<p>
    Okay, so that probably comes as no shocker to those of you who know me, but
    it's the little things that make me realize it myself.
</p>
<p>
    I've been frequenting <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a> for
    a couple of years now, mainly to garner ideas and code to help me with my
    personal or work projects. I rarely post comments, and I've only once
    submitted a question to the site. However, I <strong>do</strong> frequent
    the site regularly, and the few comments I've put in -- generally regarding
    usage of <a href="http::/search.cpan.org/search?query=CGI%3A%3AApplication">CGI::Application</a>
    -- have been typically well-moderated.
</p>
<p>
    Well, yesterday I <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=408255">made a comment</a> to a user <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=408231">asking about editors to
        use with perl</a>. I was incensed by a remark he made about <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> not having the features he needed.
    Now, as I said in my comment, I've used VIM on a daily basis for over two
    years, and I'm <em>still</em> discovering new features -- and I've used all
    of the features he was looking for.
</p>
<p>
    This is where I discovered I'm a geek: my comment made it into the <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=Best%20Nodes">Daily
    Best</a> for today, peaking around number 5. The fact that that made my day
    indicates to me that I <em>must</em> be a geek.
</p>
<p>
    Oh -- and VIM rules!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/46-MySQL-Miscellanae.html">MySQL Miscellanae</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    Inspired by a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/13/2016211">Slashdot book
        review</a> of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hpmysql/index.html">High
        Performance MySQL</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I've often suspected that I'm not a SQL guru... little things like being
    self taught and having virtually no resources for learning it. This has been
    confirmed to a large degree at work, where our DBA has taught me many tricks
    about databases: indexing, when to use DISTINCT, how and when to do JOINs,
    and the magic of TEMPORARY TABLEs. I now feel fairly competent, though far
    from being an expert -- I certainly don't know much about how to tune a
    server for MySQL, or tuning MySQL for performance.
</p>
<p>
    Last year around this time, we needed to replace our MySQL server, and I
    got handed the job of getting the data from the old one onto the new. At the
    time, I looked into replication, and from there discovered about binary
    copies of a data store. I started using this as a way to backup data,
    instead of periodic mysqldumps.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I've often wondered since: would replication be a good way to do
    backups? It seems like it would, but I haven't investigated.
    One post on the aforementioned Slashdot article addressed this, with the
    following summary:
</p>
<ol>
     <li>Set up replication</li>
     <li>Do a locked table backup on the slave</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Concise and to the point. I only wish I had a spare server on which to
    implement it!

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/41-Cgiapp-Roadmap.html">Cgiapp Roadmap</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I've had a few people contact me indicating interest in Cgiapp, and I've
    noticed a number of subscribers to the freshmeat project I've setup. In
    addition, we're using the library extensively at the <a href="http://www.garden.org">National Gardening Association</a> in
    developing our new site (the current site is using a mixture of ASP and
    Tango, with several newer applications using PHP). I've also been monitoring
    the CGI::Application mailing list. As a result of all this activity, I've
    decided I need to develop a roadmap for Cgiapp.
</p>
<p>Currently, planned changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Version 1.x series:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding a Smarty registration for stripslashes (the Smarty
            "function" call will be sslashes).</li>
            <li>param() bugfix: currently, calling param() with no arguments
            simply gives you a list of parameters registered with the method,
            but not their values; this will be fixed.</li>
            <li>error_mode() method. The CGI::Application ML brought up and
            implemented the idea of an error_mode() method to register
            an error_mode with the object (similar to run_modes()). While
            non-essential, it would offer a standard, built-in hook for error
            handling.</li>
            <li>$PATH_INFO traversing. Again, on the CGI::App ML, a request was
            brought up for built-in support for using $PATH_INFO to determine
            the run mode. Basically, you would pass a parameter indicating which
            location in the $PATH_INFO string holds the run mode.</li>
            <li>DocBook tutorials. I feel that too much information is given in
            the class-level documentation, and that usage tutorials need to be
            written. Since I'm documenting with PhpDoc and targetting PEAR,
            moving tutorials into DocBook is a logical step.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Version 2.x series:</b><br>
        Yes, a Cgiapp2 is in the future. There are a few changes that are either
        necessitating (a) PHP5, or (b) API changes. In keeping with PEAR
        guidelines, I'll rename the module Cgiapp2 so as not to break
        applications designed for Cgiapp.<br><br>
        Changes expected include:
        <ul>
            <li>Inherit from PEAR. This will allow for some built in error
            handling, among other things. I suspect that this will tie in with
            the error_mode(), and may also deprecate croak() and carp().</li>
            <li>Changes to tmpl_path() and load_tmpl(). In the perl version, you
            would instantiate a template using load_tmpl(), assign your
            variables to it, and then do your fetch() on it. So, this:
                <pre>
$this->tmpl_assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
                </pre>
            Becomes this:
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl();
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch('template.html');
                </pre>
            OR
                <pre>
$tmpl = $this->load_tmpl('template.html');
$tmpl->assign('var1', 'val1');
$body = $tmpl->fetch();
                </pre>
            (Both examples assume use of Smarty.) I want to revert to
            this behaviour for several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Portability with perl. This is one area in which the PHP
                    and perl versions differ greatly; going to the perl way
                    makes porting classes between the two languages
                    simpler.</li>
                    <li>Decoupling. The current set of template methods create
                    an object as a parameter of the application object - which
                    is fine, unless the template object instantiator returns an
                    object of a different kind.</li>
                </ul>
            Cons:
                <ul>
                     <li>Smarty can use the same object to fill multiple
                     templates, and the current methods make use of this. By
                     assigning the template object locally to each method, this
                     could be lost.<br><br>
                     HOWEVER... an easy work-around would be for load_tmpl() to
                     create the object and store it an a parameter; subsequent
                     calls would return the same object reference. The
                     difficulty then would be if load_tmpl() assumed a template
                     name would be passed.  However, even in CGI::App, you
                     decide on a template engine and design for that engine;
                     there is never an assumption that template engines should
                     be swappable.</li>
                     <li>Existing Cgiapp1 applications would need to be
                     rewritten.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Plugin Architecture:</b>
                The CGI::App ML has produced a ::Plugin namespace that utilizes
                a common plugin architecture. The way it is done in perl is
                through some magic of namespaces and export routines... both of
                which are, notably, missing from PHP.<br><br>
                However, I think I may know a workaround for this, if I use
                PHP5: the magic __call() overloader method.<br><br>
                My idea is to have plugin classes register methods that should
                be accessible by a Cgiapp-based class a special key in the
                $_GLOBALS array.  Then, the __call() method would check the
                key for registered methods; if one is found matching a method
                requested, that method is called (using call_user_func()), with
                the Cgiapp-based object reference as the first reference. Voila!
                instant plugins!<br><br>
                Why do this? A library of 'standard' plugins could then be
                created, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A form validation plugin</li>
                    <li>Alternate template engines as plugins (instead of
                    overriding the tmpl_* methods)</li>
                    <li>An authorization plugin</li>
                </ul>
                Since the 'exported' methods would have access to the Cgiapp
                object, they could even register objects or parameters with it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    <div class="entry body"><p>The new weierophinney.net/matthew/ site is now up and running!</p>
<p>
    The site has been many months in planning, and about a month or so in actual
    coding. I have written the site in, instead of flatfiles, PHP, so as to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allow easier updating (it includes its own content management system</li>
    <li>Include a blog for my web development and IT interests</li>
    <li>Allow site searching (everything is an article or download)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I've written it using a strict MVC model, which means that I have libraries
    for accessing and manipulating the database; all displays are template
    driven (meaning I can create them with plain-old HTML); and I can create
    customizable applications out of various controller libraries. I've called
    this concoction <strong>Dragonfly</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    There will be more developments coming -- sitewide search comes to mind, as
    well as RSS feeds for the blog and downloads.
</p>
<p>Stay Tuned!</p></div>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    After working on some OO classes yesterday for an application backend I'm
    developing for work, I decided I needed to create a <tt>BREAD</tt> class to
    make this simpler. You know,
    <b>B</b>rowse-<b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>dit-<b>A</b>dd-<b>D</b>elete.
</p>
<p>
    At first, I figured I'd build off of what I'd done yesterday. But then I got
    to thinking (ah, thinking, my curse). I ran into the <tt>BREAD</tt> concept
    originally when investigating <tt>CGI::Application</tt>; a number of
    individuals had developed <tt>CGI::Apps</tt> that provided this
    functionality. I'd discarded them usually because they provided more
    functionality than I needed or because they introduced more complexity than
    I was willing to tackle right then.
</p>
<p>
    But once my thoughts had gone to <tt>BREAD</tt> and <tt>CGI::App</tt>, I
    started thinking how nice it would be to have <tt>CGI::Application</tt> for
    PHP. And then I thought, why not? What prevents me from porting it? I have
    the source...
</p>
<p>
    So, today I stayed home with Maeve, who, on the tail end of an illness,
    evidently ran herself down when at daycare yesterday, and stayed home
    sleeping most of the day. So, while she was resting, I sat down with a
    printout of the non-POD code of <tt>CGI::App</tt> and hammered out what I
    needed to do. Then, when she fell asleep for a nap, I typed it all out and
    started testing. And, I'm proud to say, it works. For an example, visit <a href="http://dev.weierophinney.net/cgiapp/test.php">my development
        site</a> to see a very simple, templated application in action.

    <h4 class="entry"><a href="/blog/33-B.-Gates-Open-Source-Programmer.html">B. Gates: Open Source Programmer?</a></h4>

    <div class="entry body"><p>
    I just read <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2004/03/19/programmers_at_work/">coverage 
        of a panel of programming luminaries on Salon;</a> the topic of
    discussion was about the state of programming. In the course of the
    discussion, the subject of Open Source came up. Several of the luminaries --
    which included architects of the Mac OS and Windows, as well as others --
    derided the community for basically reinventing the wheel, and wheels that
    need to be re-thought entirely anyways. One questioned, "Why is hte idealism
    just about how the code is shared -- what about idealism about the code
    itself?"
</p>
<p>
    Andy Hertzfeld (who helped develop the original Mac OS)  was sitting on the
    panel, and jumped in. He has been working with Eazel and Chandler in recent
    years, and thus has an inside view of open source. His initial comment:
    "It's because they want people to use the stuff!" Basically, they program
    Windows- or Mac-like interfaces because then people will be willing to try
    it out. They program office suites because people "need" an office suite to
    be productive. Such offerings hook them into the OSS movement.
</p>
<p>
    Another participant, Dan Bricklin (of VisiCalc, a pioneering spreadsheet
    program) shared an anecdote from Bill Gates. Evidently, Gates gave an
    interview (with Lammers -- look up this person) in which he explained that
    his work on MS's BASIC compiler was done by looking at how other programmers
    had accomplished the task. In his own words, "The best way to prepare is to
    write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written.
    In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I
    fished out listings of their operating systems." 
</p>
<p>
    So basically, Gates was an early adopter of OSS methodologies... Interesting
    to see that today he's so protective of MS code. Guess money might do that
    to you.
