PURPOSE
=======

This is a demonstration app, used for two purposes:

 * Sandbox for playing with model ideas, using a blog as the example
 * Sandbox for prototyping ZF2 MVC ideas

The code does not work completely and makes a number of assumptions (e.g.,
you're using PHP 5.3; ext/mongo is installed, and running on default ports;
etc.). Some ideas are very much in flux (input validation and forms), others are
relatively stable (event manager usage).

You will need a current version (tested on 87504edc) of ZF2 from my repository:

    https://github.com/weierophinney/zf2

pointing at the branch "prototype/mvc-module". The library/ directory should
either be on your include_path, or its "library/Zend" subdirectory symlinked
into "library/" of your checkout.
